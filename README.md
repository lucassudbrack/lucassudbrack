## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucas Sudbrack, a brazilian guy currently working at Lastro Co., the company responsible for bringing the future of AI to legacy markets, as the Real Estate one.
My job as a Data Product Manager is to design company's operational data pipelines, assuring data governance and making the numbers real and reliable for further analysis.

Currently enrolled to Le Wagon's Data Engineering Bootcamp, I'm still a begginer on Data Engineering and coding, but getting each day better and better!
